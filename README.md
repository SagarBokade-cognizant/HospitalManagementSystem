# HospitalManagementSystem
The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based application that streamlines administrative and patient care operations in a hospital. Designed for scalability and ease of use, the system is modular and follows the MVC architecture, making it compatible with both Java (Spring MVC) and .NET (ASP.NET Core MVC) frameworks.
